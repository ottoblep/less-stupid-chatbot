# less-stupid-chatbot

This is a talking chatbot that uses [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), [PyTTSX3](https://pypi.org/project/pyttsx3/), [Kaldi](www.kaldi-asr.org) and [Vosk](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api).\
Prompts are optimized for [Llama-2](https://ai.meta.com/llama/) but the script is model agnostic.\
On a decently sized Nvidia GPU this enables a real-time conversation with the model.\
The dependencies and installation are absolute chaos, so try getting this to run at your own risk.
